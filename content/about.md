I’m a PhD student at Dunsink Observatory , Dublin Institute for Advanced
Studies (DIAS) - specifically working in the Planetary Magnetospheres group. I
study Mercury’s magnetosphere and its interaction with the solar environment
through the analysis of large data-sets from NASA’s MESSENGER mission
(2011-2015), and upon its arrival, ESA/JAXA’s BepiColombo. My work currently
focuses on Mercury’s magnetospheric boundaries - the bow shock and magnetopause
and the automated detection of boundary crossings via simple machine learning
methods. I’m a Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholar, fully funded by
Research Ireland.

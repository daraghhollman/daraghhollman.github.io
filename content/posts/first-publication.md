I recently was successful in publishing my first piece of first-author work, entitled: _"Identifying MESSENGER Magnetospheric Boundary Crossings Using a Random Forest Region Classifier"_.

This work was published to the Journal of Geophysical Research: Machine Learning and Computation on 12th February 2026.

In this study, we create an efficient and effective machine learning model to classify magnetospheric region for the entirety of the MESSENGER mission with high accuracy (> 98%). From these classifications we then find ~20k individual bow shock crossings, and ~12k magnetopause crossings.

I explain this study in plain language [here](/posts/messenger-crossing-detection.md) (WIP), and you can find the paper online [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2025JH000921).

In the summer of 2023, together with the [DIAS Planetary Magnetospheres
group](https://www.dias.ie/cosmicphysics/astrophysics/astro-research/astro-planetary-magnetospheres/),
I led the development and release of a new plotting tool for data from the
Juno spacecraft (currently in orbit around Jupiter).

This Juno data plotting tool (named JUPT - Juno Universal
Plotting Tool) is the first public open access tool to make the
comparison between data from different instruments - including a
magnetometer (MAG), plasma (JADE), energetic particles (JEDI),
and radio wave (WAVES) instruments. This flexible tool we
developed allows for the creation of publication-ready
multi-panel plots through the automatic source of data and
acompanying spacecraft ephemeris information.

JUPT is incredibly useful for those studying Jupiterâ€™s space environment as it
makes data visualisation quick and easy, so that researchers can spend less
time on coding and plotting, and more time on science.

JUPT is published on [Github](https://github.com/daraghhollman/JUPT) and
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8262477), with documentation published
with [ReadTheDocs](https://jupt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

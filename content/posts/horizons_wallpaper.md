A python script to plot a live wallpaper of the solar system from
the orbital information of specified objects.

This script queries the API of NASA JPLâ€™s Horizons System to
obtain orbital positions in cartesian coorinates. These are then
drawn to an image (flattened to the ecliptic) and saved as a png
or jpg to a path of your chosing.

The idea being: if you ran this script every day, and
automatically updated your wallpaper, you would essentially have a
live wallpaper of the positions of planets, asteroids, and
spacecraft.
